The files are mostly incomplete projects I have decided to build and will likely continue toiling over until I find something else to work on. Enjoy!

FCC Projects- Free Code Camp video projects I followed and slightly modified in order to become a more serious developer.

G4G Projects- Geek4Geek Python Course video projects I followed and slightly modified to become a more serious developer while learning Python [Beginner to Advanced]

Individual Projects- Completely coded by me for some random purpose:
    
  - Shadowrun Protagonist Log (WIP) -Python and Js 
      - Player can create and modify logs for their Shadowrun protagonist or other related role playing game environment
      - Hackerman interface with different themes for UX/UI functions

More coming in the future :)
