The files are mostly incomplete projects I have decided to build and will likely continue toiling over until I find something else to work on. Enjoy!

FCC Projects- Free Code Camp video projects I followed and slightly modified in order to become a more serious developer.

  - RPS.py is a rock-paper-scissors game I made after watching the tutorial video in the Introduction to Python video from Free Code Camp
    - Player Vs Computer logic + restart flag when pressing enter to exit

  - Algos.py is a program that I made loosely following the first example in the Free Code Camp Data Structures and Algorithms video
    - Features 3 search alogo types: Linear Search, Binary Search, and Recursive Binary Search
